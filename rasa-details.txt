domain.yml: This file defines the responses, intents, entities, and actions.
data/nlu.yml: Here we define the training data for your chatbot, such as how users may ask to search for pets.
data/rules.yml: This file contains the rules for how your assistant should behave during the conversation.
actions.py: This is where we write custom actions like fetching pets from your database and providing detailed responses.

In the domain.yml file, we’ll define the following:

Intents: These are what the user’s messages are trying to convey. For example, intents like greet, search_pet, and order_pet.
Entities: These are specific pieces of information from user input. For example, type, age, size, and price of pets.
Responses: These are the chatbot’s responses to the user. We'll define responses for greetings, search results, and more.
